(L1 is already in revenue),,,,OK,For Panama L1 to L1c, modifiactions pertaing only to depot. Mainline there is no change.  Hence this rule shall be OK . (L1 is already in revenue),
Rule_TMS_Signal_0009,Y,Swetha,OK,Checked OK. All signals are linked to secondary dectection device accordingly.,Shruthi,OK,All signals are linked to a Secondary Detection Device,OK,Checked OK. All signals are linked to secondary dectection device accordingly.,
Rule_TMS_Signal_0034,Y,Swetha,OK,All Signals protect the SSD in upstream. Hence OK.,Shruthi,OK,Signals protect the SDD upstream the signal. Signals of type SLT_End are at the end of track and does not protect any SDD,OK,Signals protect the SDD upstream the signal. Signals of type SLT_End are at the end of track and does not protect any SDD,
Rule_POSWI_0005,Y,Swetha,OK,Checked OK. Points are characterized with following appropriately : 
- the Kp position of the point toe,
•  the Kp position of the fouling point,
•  the distance between the beginning of the point and the toe 
•  the distance between the toe and the ending of the point heel for the normal branch
•  the distance between the toe and the ending of the point heel for the divergent branch. Hence OK.,Shruthi,OK,Toe Kp, D_Toe_joint, D_Normal_Toe_Fouling_Point_Joint and D_Reverse_Toe_Fouling_Point_Joint are defined for all the points. Hence ok,OK,Checked OK. Points are characterized with following appropriately : 
- the Kp position of the point toe,
•  the Kp position of the fouling point,
•  the distance between the beginning of the point and the toe 
•  the distance between the toe and the ending of the point heel for the normal branch
•  the distance between the toe and the ending of the point heel for the divergent branch. Hence OK.,
Rule_SYS_DIM_0006,N,Prabhakar,OK,only 24 trains defined in the projects,,,,OK,only 24 trains defined in the projects,
Rule_SYS_DIM_0012,N,Prabhakar,OK,Checked OK,,,,OK,Checked OK,
Rule_DB_Track_Container_0007,N,Prabhakar,OK,Checked OK. No_Evacuation_wayside is different from None only on the mainline tracks,,,,OK,Checked OK. No_Evacuation_wayside is different from None only on the mainline tracks,
Rule_DB_TRAINS_0006,Y,Swetha,OK,C_Max_Mov_Train_Immo is set to zero. Hence OK.,Bupendra,OK,Ok, C_Max_Mov_Train_Immo is defined 0 in SyDT.,OK,Ok, C_Max_Mov_Train_Immo is defined 0 in SyDT.,
Rule_CBTC_SPEED,Y,Swetha,NOK,CBTC_Max_Speed speed is set to 91 kmph in SyDT and 90 kmph in RTI. Hence NOK.,Bupendra,OK,OK, CBTC_Max_Speed is defined 91Km/h,NOK,CBTC_Max_Speed speed is set to 91 kmph in SyDT and 90 kmph in RTI. Hence NOK.,
Rule_Depot_SPEED,Y,Swetha,NOK,Depot_Max_Speed is undefined in SyCR. Hence NOK.,Shruthi,OK,Depot_Max_Speed is defined in the project.,NOK,Depot_Max_Speed is undefined in SyCR. Hence NOK.,
Rule_Rollback_Max_Distance,Y,Swetha,OK,SyDT data matches with RTI data. Hence OK.,Shruthi,OK,Rollback_Max_Distance is much smaller than the Safety_Rollback_Triggering distance. Hence Ok,OK,Rollback_Max_Distance is much smaller than the Safety_Rollback_Triggering distance. Hence Ok,
Safety_Rollback_Triggering,Y,Swetha,OK,C_Safety_Rollback_Triggering value defined in SyDT matches with RTI. Hence OK.,Bupendra,NOK,NOK, for TRFC_N3 C_Safety_Rollback_Triggering is defined 51 cm, while in RTI for both train it is defined 50cm.,NOK,NOK, for TRFC_N3 C_Safety_Rollback_Triggering is defined 51 cm, while in RTI for both train it is defined 50cm.,
